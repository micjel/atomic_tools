atomic_tools is a library that provides basic postprocessing methods for effective interaction .snt files generated by the imsrg++ and KSHELL valence-space diagonalization
codes for atomic systems. Namely, it can provide ground states, binding energies, excitation spectra, and other operator expectation values. 

The Snt_scripts class also contains a number of automation routines for running KSHELL, which can be helpful. To use, it, you need to download it from https://sites.google.com/alumni.tsukuba.ac.jp/kshell-nuclear/. If you are working locally, run 
```
cd <kshell directory>/src
make single
```

A prerequisite is the installation of KSHELL and mylib_python. These should be added to your PATH.
