`atomic_tools` is a library that provides basic postprocessing methods for effective interaction .snt files generated by the `imsrg++` and `KSHELL` valence-space diagonalization
codes for atomic systems. It provides a wrapper to `KSHELL` and `mylib_python` to extract ground states, binding energies, and excitation spectra. Currently, it only supports $s$, $p$, and $d$-block atoms; these are the only ones that have been tested with `imsrg++` as well. 

**Prerequisites**
- Any Python 3 installation should be sufficient
- A working `KSHELL` installation is required to use the `KSHELL` wrapper within the ``Snt`` class. To use it, you need to download it from https://sites.google.com/alumni.tsukuba.ac.jp/kshell-nuclear/

If you are working locally, run 
```
cd <kshell directory>/src
make single
```
to install it, and link to `kshell.exe` in your scripts.
